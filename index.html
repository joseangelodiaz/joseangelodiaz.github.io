<p>	One problem which can be observed by any city traveller or anyone who takes transport to and around Sydney is the circulation. There are various blocked and inefficient circulation points especially around Sydney Harbour. Individuals that wish to travel from one side (North Sydney) to the otherside (Balmain) have to take the Sydney Harbour Bridge which then they have to pay a toll price of $2.50 - $4. But what if we made travelling much faster without having to pay. That would be the more viable solution to inefficient circulation. </p>

<p> Our plan is to create a 3D representation of a suspension bridge which connects two areas of land over a sea of water. This idea would be able to utilise unused space on water. Bridges will start from each "tip" of the city coasts, bridging from North Sydney (Ashton Park) into the Eastern Side of Sydney (Point Piper). These two destination points were chosen as it eases the amount of traffic that occurs within the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Not only that, having a bridge interconnecting from North Sydney to East Sydney saves commuters travelling from these directions idleing in traffic in the Sydney CBD. </p>

<p> The suspension bridge will be double laned, also offering cyclists an alternate route.  The placement of the bridge has significance as the traffic in Sydney, especially on the Harbour Bridge, negates commuters from reaching their destination in time. This bridge offers commuters that travel in the Sydney CBD and live in the Eastern Side of Sydney a method of reaching home faster. This Suspension Bridge aims to reduce air congestion and traffic congestion from further worsening the quality of life of Sydney citizens whilst giving drivers and cyclists a better route of travel.<p>
